# Bitwise Maximizer

## Overview
The Bitwise Maximizer is a Java application designed to calculate the maximum possible value of a given set of integers through specific bitwise operations. It takes an array of integers as input and processes them to maximize a value based on predefined criteria.

## Features
- **Input Handling**: Accepts an array of integers through standard input.
- **Bitwise Operation**: Implements a function to maximize an integer value using bitwise operations.
- **Output**: Displays the maximum possible value after computation.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Running the Application
To run the Bitwise Maximizer, follow these steps:
1. Ensure Java is properly installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java file: `BitwiseMaximizer.java`
3. Run the compiled class file: BitwiseMaximizer
4. Follow the prompts in the application to input the array size and the integers.

## Usage
Upon running the application, you'll be prompted to input:
- **N**: The size of the array.
- **Array Elements**: N integers that constitute the array.

Once the inputs are provided, the application processes the data and outputs the maximum possible value based on the implemented bitwise operation.
